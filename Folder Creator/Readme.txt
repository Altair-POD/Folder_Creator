Simple folder creator...

just set the path and folder starting  and finishing number 
and create your desired folders just by clicking the "Make" button.


you are wondering why i made this GUI.

i started to watching a tv-series. and I needed the subtitle and the vedio file in the same folder. and if you got 20 episodes of 
tv-series and your time will waste for creating 20 folders for each episodes. so this GUI can help you with it. Tschuss.
